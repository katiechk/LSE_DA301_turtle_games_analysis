## Week 1

- Both spending scores and annual income do have positive relationship with the loyalty points. This indicates that customers with higher spending scores or higher annual income tend to have a higher loyalty points with them. The impact of annual income is slightly more than spending scores givent that the difference in coefficient. Yet the Adj. R-squared is too low that the model might not be accurate enough. We recommend to try with different model for a more accurate result.
- In contrast, age has a relatively weak and negative relationship with score points with a negative coefficient. This indicates customers tend to lower their loyalty when they get older, this might due to the increase in shopping option. Similar with the above, the Adj. R-squared is not credible enough to fully trust the model.
- It is interesting to further explore if other variables such as gender and education will have strong relationship with the loyalty points. It will be good to also explore other model for better accuracy.
